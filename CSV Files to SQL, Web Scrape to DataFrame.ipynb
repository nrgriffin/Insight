       " 'Located in a small group of campsites on the Southern end of the Blob formation. Please ask permission for bouldering in occupied campsites.   Stem Gem is the Quintessencial JTree boulder problem, embodying the essence of Joshua Tree climbing: Highly technical and often times perplexing movement across extremely friction dependant, featurless granite. Indeed, this problem has nary a hold on it, the only thing making it climbable is its coarse friction and the undulating nature of the stone.   Getting both feet off the ground on this problem can be an event in itself, bringing ones flexability and stemming prowess to task. Start by stemming up the concave face and then traversing right across a faint/blunt arete. Most continue right and stand on the \"bump\", however it is possible to avoid the bump and friction direct (v3 friction in itself), continue up the water groove and to the top of the boulder. Jump across boulder to get off.',\n",

Traversing high at the start and utilizing the \"hidden\" hold, this problem might be V6, traversing low at the start is probably more like V7, avoiding the \"hidden\" hold is even a bit harder (IMO more esthetic). I think this problem deserves AT LEAST 1 star, prolly 2 because of the uniqueness of the climbing involved.   The sit starts low on the far right of the cave at a pinch and a sloping undercling, about 10 feet below the regular start. Crumbly starting holds have made this start harder over the years.

The 5.11 rating is what's given in the Vogel guide, while the V5 is what's given in the bouldering guide (That guy also only gave it three out of five stars.
